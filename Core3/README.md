## SWGPort3's goal for Core3 
The goal for Core3 within the SWGPort3 is to modify the Core3 engine so that it can run with a mac m1. Research/documentation can be found at the repo: SWGEmu-Core-M1Comp/core3-engine3-research/.

I have already identified errors within Core3 that will be pushed to this repo.
